# 4Dollar-Instruction-Set-Architecture
The goal of this project is building our own ISA with its relevant software and hardware.  This will be a processor with 8 bit instructions and 8 bit data (registers and memory), which we optimize for the PRPG program we have worked on in previous project, and showcase our result with a Python simulator
